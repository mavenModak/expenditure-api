# **Money Tracker REST API**

Tracking different expenditures.

A RESTful API created using Spring Boot. I have used PostgreSQL as the relational database and JdbcTemplate to interact with that. Apart from this, I have used JSON Web Token (JWT) to add authentication. Using JWT, we can protect certain endpoints and ensure that user must be logged-in to access those.
